# NEXT TWO WEEKS

## Bigger Tasks

### First user test pass

Goals:

* Is this faster/easier/better for you to share links?
  * Is oauth an issue?
  * sharing is easier/better
  * is it simple or understandable?

Tasks:

* Start Page for the add-on
  * Video explaining it
  * Link to to install extension (host locally for now)

* First experience clicking on the share button


* hide email, and debug tabs

* Settings tab should reflect accounts signed in, and link to account page

* Change the sharing flow:
  * Change "need auth" screen
  * Change retry screen
  * Change error screen
  * Provide specialized positive feedback on first share
  * Provide positive feedback experience for every share
  
* Share UI
  * Shorten links for twitter.

* Account settings page:
  * List possible services (twitter/facebook for testing)
  * Show list of accounts that Linkdrop knows about, which ones are active,
    a way to sign in/out for each one.
  * Explain how to revoke Linkdrop from their service
  * For sign out:
    * Navigate to signout URL for the particular host in a browser window, to
      clear their browser cookies for that site
    * Call new Linkdrop API to remove that account from Linkdrop session.


## Smaller Changes

* Tag FF bookmarks with share data so they are picked up in sync.
* Chrome to phone
* Give another way to access history page outside of the "shared!" status.
* If browser goes to about:config (non-web pages), do not show the share UI, or show a "not allowed" UI.
* use https for the linkdrop site
* Change extension to start reveal animation right away instead of waiting for iframe onload. Difficult,
  since animating while the browser component loads means the animation is choppy. Perhaps put in a placeholder
  xul element and have the browser page load in the background, then swap them once the page loads. Or,
  pre-seed the browser cache with the page, by requesting it after first install?


# OTHER TASKS

* Set up testing/benchmarking
  * Set up a mock service that we can use for testing send API?
* Switch to async/queue-based send API
* Use google contacts API to enable gmail tab autocomplete for To: address
