# NEXT TWO WEEKS

## Bigger Tasks

### First user test pass

Goals:

* Is this faster/easier/better for you to share links?
  * Is oauth an issue?
  * sharing is easier/better
  * is it simple or understandable?

User testing questions:
- Does the icon make sense?
- Does the acount sign in work for you? (something like that)
- Would you recommend to other?

Tasks:

* Start Page for the add-on
  * Video explaining it
    * Sell video: make the case for using the extension. 45 seconds or less.
  * Video on reload after install
    * How to use it. Adding accounts then doing a share. Can be longer
  * Link to to install extension (host locally for now)

* First experience clicking on the share button

* If navigate away, first time, shrink the bar, tell them they can click on the
  share button to bring it back.

* Change the sharing flow:
  * use box overlay when doing the share instead of shrinking the screen.
  * Rewrite "need auth" screen
    * If do share, but account changes, then do not auto share, go back to share,
      with new account info, let them know that account changed.
  * Rewrite retry screen
  * Rewrite error screen
  * Provide specialized positive feedback on first share
  * Provide positive feedback experience for every share
    * Indicate bookmarking is being done, option to opt out.

* Account settings tab (no standalone page):
  * Detect twitter/facebook logged in reliable:
    * Load twitter.com, look for <meta content="userNameHere" name="session-user-screen_name" />
    * Load facebook.com: grep for new Presence(\"100000423120383\". A bit brittle.
    * Both hit the web site, so triggers analytics/facebook may try to sign you into chat? Sound
      in the background?
  * If user clicks remove link, then add, always use OAuth forceLogin, but only for
    the remove/add case, not for first adds.

* Bugs
  * Twitter: if api send gets 403 duplicate, then we show need to authenticate instead of duplicate.

* Reconsider the long and short URL being shown next to the text input.

## Smaller Changes

* Chrome to phone
* Give another way to access history page outside of the "shared!" status.
* If browser goes to about:config (non-web pages), do not show the share UI, or show a "not allowed" UI.
  At the very least, check for exceptions on these pages, about:config has a canvas error at the moment.
* Change extension to start reveal animation right away instead of waiting for iframe onload. Difficult,
  since animating while the browser component loads means the animation is choppy. Perhaps put in a placeholder
  xul element and have the browser page load in the background, then swap them once the page loads. Or,
  pre-seed the browser cache with the page, by requesting it after first install?


# OTHER TASKS

* Set up testing/benchmarking
  * Set up a mock service that we can use for testing send API?
* Switch to async/queue-based send API
* Use google contacts API to enable gmail tab autocomplete for To: address
