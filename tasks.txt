Tasks:

* David: get a privacy policy.

* Name change? - David/Legal.
    * Alternate name ideas?

* Design for interface when system is running slowly (503 message) - Andy
    * Fail whale

* Move code to GitHub:
    - linkdrop
    - linkdrop-prod, private

* Blog post - Andy
  * mention the constraints with email/contacts API
  * Talk about navigator.share/linkdrop.share?
  * what are the problems to solve? navigator.share.
    * privacy.

* Linux has no icon? - James

* Server down messaging: - James
    - Small messaging for the extension's frame: serve from server but also
      include in extension for cases where not reachable
    - A little bit larger messaging when a full page outage, that will be
      served from the server, with a div Gozer can change contents of with
      custom error message.

* Persistent sessions - Shane/Gozer
  - gozer is looking at membase, a persistent store that is memcached compatible

* linkdrop.share() in the page?
    * Idea or prototype?
    - prototype is available: navigator.mozilla.labs.share() to toggle the share panel

* Post the add-on on AMO. - Shane, Bryan review.

--- optional ----

* Set up page with analytics - Shane

* Make sure button shows up in same place in browsers across platforms. - James

* Check server logs for errors: facebook error - Shane
    * When facebook failed it got weird.

* Gozer: Box for admin work.

* If redo video: video should reflect real ui, not custom position for toolbar button

-------------------------


* Speed of page display: - James
  * make sure files can be aggressively cached.

  
* extension: watch for 50* http errors in api calls (503 service unavailable), present user with nice message.


* Time for a new name, avoid conflict with linkdrop.com
  * Consistent Branding! across extension, OAUTH app names, front page, extension ID, etc...  - Bryan (coordinate)
  * Twitter OAuth - "Linkdrop" is taken, probably by linkdrop.com, so we have to use "Mozilla Linkdrop"

* make config files inherit a 'default' so we can have some values for the
  production server (they may already support this) - Shane

* define branching/tagging used for production server, limit production server
  to updating on those tags, and are there any controls we can do to ensure
  the server does not update via unauthorized commits? - Gozer/Mark/Shane

* Maybe consider something different for the settings tab icon and button. -Andy

* Store info on if first share, and if so after first share, give them a link to the service to see if it shared. - Bryan
  * Done, but not pushed until after this round of user testing.

* Hide the "Congratulations" bar after people click the toolbar button.

* Save persistent cookie for linkdrop session? Video says only need to save the name once, need
to reconcile expectations.

----------------------

* NEED BETTER ERROR MESSAGES from extension for when it cannot work, like:
  * going to an ip address URL
  * going to an about: URL

  * If user clicks remove link, then add, always use OAuth forceLogin, but only for
    the remove/add case, not for first adds.
    - in the backend, this is done for the services that support it, for
      twitter, you must add 'force_login=true' to the post data when calling
      /api/account/authorize. For google, add 'pape_max_auth_age=0'.

* Bugs
  * Share per tab can possibly close the wrong (or not close the shared) linkdrop if you've switched tabs

* Reconsider the long and short URL being shown next to the text input.

## Smaller Changes

* Chrome to phone
* Give another way to access history page outside of the "shared!" status.
* If browser goes to about:config (non-web pages), do not show the share UI, or show a "not allowed" UI.
  At the very least, check for exceptions on these pages, about:config has a canvas error at the moment.
* Change extension to start reveal animation right away instead of waiting for iframe onload. Difficult,
  since animating while the browser component loads means the animation is choppy. Perhaps put in a placeholder
  xul element and have the browser page load in the background, then swap them once the page loads. Or,
  pre-seed the browser cache with the page, by requesting it after first install?


# OTHER TASKS

* Set up testing/benchmarking
  * Set up a mock service that we can use for testing send API?
* Switch to async/queue-based send API
* Use google contacts API to enable gmail tab autocomplete for To: address
