## optional settings release work

* Figure out stats gathering for third party calls. - Mark
* The "logged out" message is a bit scary, and it is not clear, if you get it
  while after typing a share message, that the message is in localStorage, and
  if you log in with the same account type and name, then your message will
  still be available.
* FE perf - James
  * appcache
* If do oauth and cancel, be sure current tab selection is cleared - James
* After oauth is done, be sure that the account/get is called before updating
  the UI - James

* For staging box, reference staging xpi for the install button. - James 
* HTML5 autocomplete - James
  * May need to talk to satchel owner for FF4 if does not work out, to
    make autocomplete provider more robust and officially supported.
  * >> Contacts Addon messes up HTML5 autocomplete!
* HTML5/FF friendly option for the video - Bryan
* aTab is null in minefied - James
  * notificationBox.insertBefore(iframeNode, notificationBox.firstChild); seems to cause it, at least in FF4 beta 6
* Privacy policy update? - David
  * Make the policy and link clear it is F1 privacy policy, put link under install button?
* noscript breaks the UI
  https://github.com/mozilla/f1/issues#issue/16
* Make youtube videos playable in Facebook
  https://github.com/mozilla/f1/issues#issue/17

  dmandelin's family advice.




# Work out common share icon

* Andy
* add F1 logo in the share frame so users know where the feature came from/what
  to tell others.
* Update f1 home page image -- the top one shows twitter with the link
  under the title, but we have since then removed showing the link in that area,
  and Accounts is now on the far left.

  The fourth is "Gmail". What does that mean? Does it mean "Gmail address (if different from Google account")

* What if bitly breaks? reaches API limits? Make sure error mentions bitly api thing. - shane/James
  This page: http://code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiBestPractices#HTTP_Response_Status_Codes
