# NEXT TWO WEEKS

## Bigger Tasks

### First user test pass

Goals:

* Is this faster/easier/better for you to share links?
  * Is oauth an issue?
  * sharing is easier/better
  * is it simple or understandable?

User testing questions:
- Does the icon make sense?
- Does the acount sign in work for you? (something like that)
- Would you recommend to other?

Tasks:

* Consistent Branding! across extension, OAUTH app names, front page, extension ID, etc...
  "Linkdrop by Mozilla Labs" on main page.
  "Mozilla Labs Linkdrop" for everything else.

* Do a build, preseed the UI so it is fast on first click. And just snap down the
  UI right away instead of waiting for load? Then in that case skip the animation.
  Also hide the UI until the jquery UI has been rendered, so don't see all tabs shown.

* Instructions: want honest feedback on if they would recommend.

* Above the fold work on the home page. -Andy

* Add play video to the instructions -Andy

* Add instructions to move recorder bar to the upper left (so they will see the share button after install) -Andy

* Make a note about restarting firefox -Andy

* After install, make noticeable arrow pointing up to the button in the toolbar. -Andy(design)
    * Add-on tell the page pixel location of the share button for arrow.

* Have add-on poke the page after first install instead of using the hashtag.

* If not get hosted on amo, then when click install, put a web page overlay that points to the allow button.

* Make the buttons in the fontpage less realistic, people tried to click on them. -Andy

* After add one account, transition immediately to that tab.

* Maybe consider something different for the settings tab icon. -Andy

* Description/message in facebook should be optional. But fails. Does not know to type a message in the box for facebook.

* Put in placeholder text in message area if empty. -Andy

* Store info on if first share, and if so after first share, give them a link to the service to see if it shared.

* Gozer look at logs for auth failures

* Right click on the page to also trigger the extension

* check that the account/get call if it fails show something useful.

* Show the share icon in toolbar as depressed while panel is open.

* So need share button to respond per-tab, right now open new tab, click the
  button and if open in another tab, it closes it in the other tab, but does nothing
  in current tab. User needs to click again.

* A way to test if the oauth window is not coming up very quickly?

* Save persistent cookie for linkdrop session? Video says only need to save the name once, need
to reconcile expectations.


----------------------

* NEED BETTER ERROR MESSAGES from extension for when it cannot work, like:
  * going to an ip address URL
  * going to an about: URL

  * If user clicks remove link, then add, always use OAuth forceLogin, but only for
    the remove/add case, not for first adds.

* Bugs
  * Twitter: if api send gets 403 duplicate, then we show need to authenticate instead of duplicate.

* Reconsider the long and short URL being shown next to the text input.

## Smaller Changes

* Chrome to phone
* Give another way to access history page outside of the "shared!" status.
* If browser goes to about:config (non-web pages), do not show the share UI, or show a "not allowed" UI.
  At the very least, check for exceptions on these pages, about:config has a canvas error at the moment.
* Change extension to start reveal animation right away instead of waiting for iframe onload. Difficult,
  since animating while the browser component loads means the animation is choppy. Perhaps put in a placeholder
  xul element and have the browser page load in the background, then swap them once the page loads. Or,
  pre-seed the browser cache with the page, by requesting it after first install?


# OTHER TASKS

* Set up testing/benchmarking
  * Set up a mock service that we can use for testing send API?
* Switch to async/queue-based send API
* Use google contacts API to enable gmail tab autocomplete for To: address
