Thursday morning 10am.

* aTab is null in minefied
    notificationBox.insertBefore(iframeNode, notificationBox.firstChild); seems to cause it, at least in FF4 beta 6

* What if bitly breaks? reaches API limits? Make sure error mentions bitly api thing. - shane/James
  This page: http://code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiBestPractices#HTTP_Response_Status_Codes
  seems to indicate we will get a status 200, but the json response's status_code
  will be 403 for api limit reached?

* Alerts for server having problems, tracebacks in error logs. - Gozer

* Move code to GitHub: Gozer's admin thingy.

* Blog post - Bryan

* Update home page to link to AMO for installation.
    https://addons.mozilla.org/services/install.php?addon_id=252539&src=external-f1home
    may be an option, but need to register that src="" url?

* Test flow from installing from add-on. Do testing.

* Twitter application ID is "Mozilla f1" instead of "Mozilla F1"?

* Autcomplete on ff beta 6 does not work. Need to talk to satchel owner to
  make automcomplete provider more robust and officially supported.


--- optional ----

* Look at html5 autocomplete, for minefield. Did they change the stachel UUID?

* add F1 logo in the share frame so users know where the feature came from/what
  to tell others.

* automated xpi build for AMO that increments version number.
  * no longer need web server to build extension?

* JS error tracebacks/server pings.

* A proper robots.txt? What should we exclude? Do something just to avoid
  hammering by search engines?

* Update f1 home page image -- the top one shows twitter with the link
  under the title, but we have since then removed showing the link in that area,
  and Accounts is now on the far left.

* Set up page with analytics - Shane

* Check server logs for errors: facebook error - Shane
    * When facebook failed it got weird.

* Gozer: Box for admin work.

* If redo video: video should reflect real ui, not custom position for toolbar button

-------------------------


* Speed of page display: - James
  * make sure files can be aggressively cached.

  
* extension: watch for 50* http errors in api calls (503 service unavailable), present user with nice message.

* make config files inherit a 'default' so we can have some values for the
  production server (they may already support this) - Shane

* define branching/tagging used for production server, limit production server
  to updating on those tags, and are there any controls we can do to ensure
  the server does not update via unauthorized commits? - Gozer/Mark/Shane

* Store info on if first share, and if so after first share, give them a link to the service to see if it shared. - Bryan
  * Done, but not pushed until after this round of user testing.

* Hide the "Congratulations" bar after people click the toolbar button.

* Save persistent cookie for f1 session? Video says only need to save the name once, need
to reconcile expectations.

----------------------

* NEED BETTER ERROR MESSAGES from extension for when it cannot work, like:
  * going to an ip address URL
  * going to an about: URL

  * If user clicks remove link, then add, always use OAuth forceLogin, but only for
    the remove/add case, not for first adds.
    - in the backend, this is done for the services that support it, for
      twitter, you must add 'force_login=true' to the post data when calling
      /api/account/authorize. For google, add 'pape_max_auth_age=0'.

* Bugs
  * Share per tab can possibly close the wrong (or not close the shared) f1 if you've switched tabs

* Reconsider the long and short URL being shown next to the text input.

## Smaller Changes

* Chrome to phone
* Give another way to access history page outside of the "shared!" status.
* If browser goes to about:config (non-web pages), do not show the share UI, or show a "not allowed" UI.
  At the very least, check for exceptions on these pages, about:config has a canvas error at the moment.
* Change extension to start reveal animation right away instead of waiting for iframe onload. Difficult,
  since animating while the browser component loads means the animation is choppy. Perhaps put in a placeholder
  xul element and have the browser page load in the background, then swap them once the page loads. Or,
  pre-seed the browser cache with the page, by requesting it after first install?


# OTHER TASKS

* Set up testing/benchmarking
  * Set up a mock service that we can use for testing send API?
* Switch to async/queue-based send API
* Use google contacts API to enable gmail tab autocomplete for To: address



DONE


* Double-check https urls for oauth. - Shane
  - fb redirects to http, but its POST url is https, LAME

* Persistent sessions - Shane/Gozer
  - gozer is looking at membase, a persistent store that is memcached compatible

* f1.share() in the page?
    * Idea or prototype?
    - prototype is available: navigator.mozilla.labs.share() to toggle the share panel
