    * May need to talk to satchel owner for FF4 if does not work out, to
      make autocomplete provider more robust and officially supported.
  * aTab is null in minefied - James
    * notificationBox.insertBefore(iframeNode, notificationBox.firstChild); seems to cause it, at least in FF4 beta 6

New feedback:

  https://github.com/mozilla/f1/issues#issue/16
* Make youtube videos playable in Facebook
  https://github.com/mozilla/f1/issues#issue/17
* Leave Send Link menu option in there.
  https://github.com/mozilla/f1/issues#issue/18
* Privacy policy update?
  * Make the policy and link clear it is F1 privacy policy, put link under install button?
* Meta tag changes for facebook: Facebook changed their meta tag requirements
  to include the og: (open graph) prefix.  We'll need to look for this in the
  add-on if we want to continue getting the correct open graph information from
  sites that provide it.
  [facebook developers - share](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/share)
  https://github.com/mozilla/f1/issues#issue/19
* Share option on the facebook page that shows the share? It is not showing up,
  dmandelin's family advice.

  and Accounts is now on the far left.

* What if bitly breaks? reaches API limits? Make sure error mentions bitly api thing. - shane/James
