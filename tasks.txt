# NEXT TWO WEEKS

## Specific Changes

* Tag FF bookmarks with share data so they are picked up in sync.
* Chrome to phone

  that takes user to a full web page that lists how they can log out of different
  services.
* If browser goes to about:config (non-web pages), do not show the share UI, or show a "not allowed" UI.
